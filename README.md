**Goal**: The user should be able to type into the input and, when they click a button, change the greeting to whatever they want. 

We need to see on the screen/manipulate: 

(this ends up being a list of everything that needs an id in javascript)
1) Greeting
1) Text input
1) Button

Machine language is a terrible way to do human thinking 

Let's go _grab_ everything we need: 
1) grab the greeting
    - validate by logging out 
1) grab the input
    - validate by logging out
1) grab the button
    - validate by logging out

_when_ do we want this to happen? 
    when the user clicks the button 

OnClick of the button:
1) validate that the button is listening 
    - log out the current time
1) get the user input from the text input element 
1) change the 'textContent' property of the greeting element to the user input 


The Process 
==== 

We always do the same thing when building apps: 

1. we grab some DOM elements. 
2. we add event listeners to some of those elements 
3. in response to user actions, we _do things_ to those elements
